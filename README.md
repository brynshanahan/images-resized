# Image Resizer

Based off the great work on [squoosh.app](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/squoosh/).

I don't know how to manage the wasm modules nearly as well as the guys at Chrome Labs so I'm simply including squoosh as a git submodule and directly accessing the compiled librarys from there.

The goal of this library is to make it easier to lazily create image sizes from a source image for use in content management suites.

(It is also just generally meant to be a programatic version of squoosh.app)

This project is also very much not completed
